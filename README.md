# GGButton

### Overview

Simple .wav player stylized on GGButton created on STM32 microcontroller(STM32F407VG).

### Description

   Usefullnes and simplicity was the main target in creating this project. Music files are stored on SD card
and their number is limited to 8 due to 8 positon winder used in our model. Keep in mind that these files 
need to be named 0.WAV, 1.WAV [...] 7.WAV. SPI is used to comunicate SD module with STM32. 
Handling of our project is pretty straight forward - to play music push main button, to stop it push again. 
Twist winder to change song. To change audio volume, adjust potentiometer.

### Tools

* CooCox CoIDE, Version: 1.7.8
* STM Studio

### How to run

1.Hardware needed:
* STM32f4-DISCOVERY board,
* SD Card Module and SD Card formatted to FAT32,
* 1 switch,
* 1 rotating 8 position swith(alternatively 8 normal swithes),
* 1 rotary potentiometer,
* Headphones or loudspeaker with male jack connector.
		
2.Connection instruction

3.How to run
	
* Download your audio files onto SD card(remember about proper naming).
* Build this project with CooCox CoIDE and Download Code to Flash.
	
### How to compile

* The only step is download the project and compile it with CooCox CoIDE.
